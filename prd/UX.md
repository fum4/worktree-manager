# This document outlines user experience tasks & improvements

# Redesign landing page

The landing page should be redesigned to be more catchy and better express what the app does. It should not predominantly list the features of the app, but expose to the user the app's value

# Redesign workspace page

Split workspace page into two separate pages:

- Workspace - keeps all worktree-related functionality
- Issues - keeps all issues-related functionality

Both of these should have their design improved, especially the main views (right-side), which are currently cluttered and do not look well
