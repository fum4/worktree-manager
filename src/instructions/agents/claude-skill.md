description: Create a worktree from an issue and start working on it. Use when the user says "work on PROJ-123", "work NOM-10", etc.
argument-hint: <issue-id>
allowed-tools: mcp__dawg__*
---

The user wants to work on issue $ARGUMENTS.

IMPORTANT: Use ONLY the dawg MCP tools (`mcp__dawg__*`) to interact with dawg. Do NOT read `.dawg/` files or make HTTP requests to the dawg server. All communication goes through the MCP tools.

---

## Steps

1. **Create the worktree** by calling the right MCP tool based on the issue identifier:
   - Jira-style key (e.g. PROJ-123, or just a number) → `mcp__dawg__create_from_jira` with `issueKey` param
   - Linear-style key (e.g. ENG-42, NOM-10) → `mcp__dawg__create_from_linear` with `identifier` param

2. **Wait for creation** — poll `mcp__dawg__list_worktrees` until the worktree status changes from `creating` to `stopped`

3. **Navigate** to the worktree path returned in the response

4. **Check hooks** — call `mcp__dawg__get_hooks_config` to discover all configured hooks.
   - Always inform the user before running any hooks/skills/commands, and summarize results after
   - For each skill: call `mcp__dawg__report_hook_status` BEFORE (without `success`/`summary`) to show loading in the UI, invoke the skill, then call it AGAIN with the result
   - Run pre-implementation hooks before starting work
   - Check custom hook conditions as you work
   - Run post-implementation hooks when done

5. **Read TASK.md** to understand the task from the original issue details, then follow AI context directions and todos — these are user-defined and take priority over the task description when they conflict

6. **Plan before coding** — enter plan mode and analyze the codebase before writing any code. Explore the relevant source files, understand existing patterns and conventions, then present a concrete implementation plan to the user. Wait for approval before starting implementation.

## Prerequisites

The dawg server must be running for MCP tools to work. Start it with `dawg` or via the Electron app.
