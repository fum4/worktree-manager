# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

dawg is a CLI tool + web UI (with optional Electron app) for managing multiple git worktrees with automatic port offsetting and Jira/Linear/GitHub integrations.

## Quick Reference

**Package manager**: pnpm

```bash
pnpm build         # Full build (tsup backend + vite frontend)
pnpm dev           # Dev mode (concurrent watchers)
pnpm check-types   # TypeScript type check
pnpm check-lint    # Lint
```

There is no test runner configured.

## Code Quality

**Fix any lint or format errors you encounter — whether introduced by current changes or pre-existing in the codebase.** Don't leave broken windows.

## Dependencies

**Always use `pnpm add` (or `pnpm add -D`) to install packages — never edit `package.json` dependencies manually.** Use the latest version unless a specific version is required.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation lives in `/docs/`. **Always check the relevant docs before working on unfamiliar areas** — they contain architectural context, component patterns, and API details that will help you make correct changes.

**CRITICAL: Keep ALL docs in sync at ALL TIMES.** After every change, check if any docs in `/docs/` or `README.md` need updating and update them immediately — this is not optional. Docs that fall out of sync are actively harmful. Specifically:

- When adding/changing API endpoints → update `docs/API.md`
- When adding/changing components, hooks, or theme tokens → update `docs/FRONTEND.md`
- When adding/changing MCP tools or instructions → update `docs/MCP.md`
- When changing architecture, adding new modules/files → update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- When adding/changing config fields → update `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`
- When changing Electron behavior → update `docs/ELECTRON.md`
- When adding/changing user-facing features → update `README.md`
- When adding a new system or concept → create a new doc file in `/docs/` and add it to the table below and in `README.md`
