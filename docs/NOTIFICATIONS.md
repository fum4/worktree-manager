# Notifications & Activity Feed

## Overview

dawg has a unified notification system that tracks events across worktrees, agents, git operations, and integrations. Events flow through a central **Activity Log** on the backend and surface in three ways:

1. **Activity Feed** — a dropdown panel in the header (bell icon) showing a scrollable timeline of events
2. **Toast notifications** — ephemeral in-app popups for high-priority events
3. **OS notifications** — native desktop notifications (Electron only) when the app is unfocused

## Architecture

```
ActivityLog (backend)
  │
  ├─ Persists events to disk (.dawg/activity.json)
  ├─ Broadcasts via SSE (/api/events → "activity" messages)
  │     │
  │     ├─ useWorktrees (SSE listener)
  │     │     └─ dispatches CustomEvent "dawg:activity" / "dawg:activity-history"
  │     │
  │     └─ NotificationManager (Electron)
  │           └─ listens to each project's SSE stream → fires native Notification
  │
  └─ REST endpoint GET /api/activity (polling fallback)
```

## Backend: ActivityLog

`ActivityLog` (`src/server/activity-log.ts`) is the central backend class. It's created by `WorktreeManager` and stored as `this.activityLog`.

### Storage

Events are persisted as newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) in `.dawg/activity.json`. Each line is one `ActivityEvent` JSON object.

### Pub/Sub

`ActivityLog` maintains an in-memory set of listeners. When `addEvent()` is called:

1. The event is appended to the NDJSON file
2. All registered listeners are notified synchronously

Listeners are registered via `subscribe(callback)`, which returns an unsubscribe function.

### Pruning

Events older than `retentionDays` (default: 7) are automatically pruned:
- On startup
- Every hour via `setInterval`

### Category Filtering

Each category can be individually enabled/disabled via config. Disabled categories are silently dropped in `addEvent()` — the event is returned but not persisted or broadcast.

### Configuration

```typescript
interface ActivityConfig {
  retentionDays: number;                    // default: 7
  categories: Record<ActivityCategory, boolean>; // all true by default
  toastEvents: string[];                    // events that trigger toast popups
  osNotificationEvents: string[];           // events that trigger OS notifications
}
```

Default toast events: `creation_completed`, `creation_failed`, `crashed`, `skill_failed`, `pr_merged`, `connection_lost`

Default OS notification events: `creation_completed`, `skill_failed`, `pr_merged`, `crashed`

Configuration is stored in the project config under the `activity` key and can be updated through the Settings view.

## API

### REST: `GET /api/activity`

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `since` | ISO 8601 string | Only return events after this timestamp |
| `category` | string | Filter by category (`agent`, `worktree`, `git`, `integration`, `system`) |
| `limit` | number | Max events to return (default: 100) |

Response: `{ events: ActivityEvent[] }` — sorted newest first.

### SSE: `GET /api/events`

The existing SSE endpoint streams activity events alongside worktree updates. Messages relevant to notifications:

| `type` field | Payload | Description |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| `activity` | `{ type: "activity", event: ActivityEvent }` | Single new event |
| `activity-history` | `{ type: "activity-history", events: ActivityEvent[] }` | Last 50 events sent on initial connection |

## Frontend

### SSE → CustomEvent Bridge

`useWorktrees` (`src/ui/hooks/useWorktrees.ts`) is the SSE client. When it receives `activity` or `activity-history` messages, it dispatches window-level CustomEvents:

- `dawg:activity` — `detail` is a single `ActivityEvent`
- `dawg:activity-history` — `detail` is an `ActivityEvent[]`

This decouples the activity feed from the SSE connection hook.

### useActivityFeed Hook

`useActivityFeed` (`src/ui/hooks/useActivityFeed.ts`) listens for those CustomEvents and manages:

- **Event list** — up to 200 events, newest first, deduplicated by `id`
- **Unread count** — increments on each new event, resets on `markAllRead()`
- **Category filter** — optional filter applied to the returned `events`
- **Toast triggering** — when an incoming event's type is in the `toastEvents` list, it calls the `onToast` callback

Returns: `{ events, allEvents, unreadCount, filter, setFilter, markAllRead, clearAll }`

### ActivityFeed Component

`ActivityFeed` (`src/ui/components/ActivityFeed.tsx`) renders the dropdown panel:

- **Header** with "Mark read" and "Clear" buttons
- **Filter chips** — All, Agent, Worktree, Git, System
- **Event list** — each item shows a category icon (color-coded), title, optional detail, relative timestamp, optional worktree ID, and a severity dot for non-info events
- Closes on outside click or Escape key
- Animated with `motion/react` (fade + scale)

### ActivityBell Component

`ActivityBell` renders the bell icon button in the header with:
- Unread badge (teal background, shows count up to 99+)
- Active state when feed is open

### Wiring in Header

`Header` (`src/ui/components/Header.tsx`) composes everything:
1. Creates `useActivityFeed` with toast callback and config-driven `toastEvents`
2. Renders `ActivityBell` in the top-right
3. Conditionally renders `ActivityFeed` in an `AnimatePresence` wrapper
4. Auto-marks events as read 500ms after opening the feed

### Settings UI

The Configuration panel (`src/ui/components/ConfigurationPanel.tsx`) includes a "Notifications" card where users can toggle which event types trigger toasts. Events are grouped by category (Worktree, Agent, Git, Integration, System) with color-coded headers matching the activity feed colors. Each event is a pill button that toggles the event type in/out of `config.activity.toastEvents`.

All event types are toggleable — every type from `ACTIVITY_TYPES` has a corresponding toggle (except `config_needs_push` which is internal).

## Electron: Native OS Notifications

`NotificationManager` (`electron/notification-manager.ts`) provides OS-level notifications when the Electron app is **unfocused**.

### How It Works

1. On project list changes, `syncProjectStreams()` is called
2. For each running project, it opens an SSE connection to `http://localhost:{port}/api/events`
3. Incoming `activity` events are checked against `OS_NOTIFICATION_EVENTS`
4. If the main window is unfocused and the event qualifies, a native `Notification` is fired

### OS Notification Events

Hardcoded set: `creation_completed`, `creation_failed`, `skill_failed`, `pr_merged`, `crashed`

### Debouncing

Max one notification per 10 seconds per project to avoid notification spam.

### Reconnection

If an SSE connection drops, it reconnects after 5 seconds (only if the project is still running).

### Click Behavior

Clicking a native notification brings the main window to focus.

## MCP: notify Action

Agents can send custom activity events via the `notify` MCP tool (`src/actions.ts`):

```
notify({ message: "Analyzing codebase structure", severity: "info", worktreeId: "PROJ-123" })
```

| Param | Required | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| `message` | yes | Status message (becomes `event.title`) |
| `severity` | no | `info` (default), `success`, `warning`, `error` |
| `worktreeId` | no | Related worktree ID |

The event is created with `category: "agent"` and `type: "notify"`.

Other MCP actions (`commit`, `push`, `create_pr`, `run_hooks`, `report_hook_status`) automatically emit their own activity events — agents don't need to call `notify` for those.

## Theme Tokens

Activity-specific tokens in `src/ui/theme.ts`:

```typescript
export const activity = {
  categoryColor: {
    agent: "text-purple-400",
    worktree: "text-teal-400",
    git: "text-blue-400",
    integration: "text-amber-400",
    system: "text-red-400",
  },
  categoryBg: {
    agent: "bg-purple-400/10",
    worktree: "bg-teal-400/10",
    git: "bg-blue-400/10",
    integration: "bg-amber-400/10",
    system: "bg-red-400/10",
  },
  severityDot: {
    success: "bg-emerald-400",
    warning: "bg-amber-400",
    error: "bg-red-400",
  },
};
```
