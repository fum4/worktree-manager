# Frontend Architecture

## Overview

The dawg frontend is a React single-page application built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query, and Framer Motion. Vite bundles it into `dist/ui/`, which the Hono backend serves as static files. The UI connects to the backend via REST API calls, Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time worktree status, and WebSockets for interactive terminal sessions.

The app operates in two modes:

- **Web mode** (single-project) -- served directly by the dawg server, uses relative URLs for API calls.
- **Electron mode** (multi-project) -- each project runs its own server instance; the app manages multiple projects with a tab bar and routes API calls to the active project's server URL.

---

## View System

The application has five top-level views, defined as the `View` type in `src/ui/components/NavBar.tsx`:

```typescript
type View = "workspace" | "agents" | "hooks" | "configuration" | "integrations";
```

### Workspace

The main view. Displays a two-panel layout: a sidebar with worktree and issue lists on the left, and a context-dependent detail panel on the right. This is where users create, start, stop, and manage worktrees and their associated issues.

### Agents

Manages MCP servers, skills, and plugins. This is the hub for configuring agent tooling -- registering MCP servers, creating/deploying skills to coding agents (Claude, Cursor, etc.), and managing Claude plugins.

### Hooks

Configures automated checks and agent skills organized by trigger type (pre-implementation, post-implementation, custom, on-demand). Users add shell command steps and import skills from the registry into each trigger type section.

### Configuration

Edits the `.dawg/config.json` settings: start commands, install commands, base branch, port discovery, environment variable mappings, and agent policy defaults.

### Integrations

Configures external service connections: Jira (OAuth credentials, project key, refresh interval), Linear (API key, team key), and GitHub (CLI installation, authentication).

The active view is persisted to `localStorage` per server URL, so switching between projects in Electron mode restores each project's last-viewed tab.

---

## Theme System

**All colors are centralized in `src/ui/theme.ts`.** Components must import from this file instead of hardcoding Tailwind color classes. This makes it possible to adjust the entire visual appearance from a single location.

### How It Works

Theme exports are objects whose values are Tailwind class fragments. Components interpolate them into `className` strings:

```typescript
import { surface, text, border } from '../../theme';

<div className={`${surface.panel} ${text.primary} border ${border.subtle}`}>
```

### Color Palette

The app uses a dark theme with a neutral slate background family and teal as the primary accent:

| Token    | Hex       | Usage                             |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| `bg0`    | `#0c0e12` | Page background                   |
| `bg1`    | `#12151a` | Panel backgrounds                 |
| `bg2`    | `#1a1e25` | Elevated surfaces (cards, modals) |
| `bg3`    | `#242930` | Input fields, pressed states      |
| `accent` | `#2dd4bf` | Primary accent (teal-400)         |

### Theme Token Categories

| Export        | Purpose                                                                                                |

| `hooks`       | Hooks accent (emerald), step result status colors                                                      |
| `notes`       | Notes tab styles, todo checkbox colors                                                                 |
| `agentRule`   | Agent rule accent (cyan), background, border styles                                                    |
| `activity`    | Activity feed category colors (agent=purple, worktree=teal, git=blue, system=red), severity dot colors |

### Integration Color Mapping

Each entity type has a consistent accent color used across the entire UI:

- **Worktree** -- teal (`#2dd4bf`)
- **Jira** -- blue (`text-blue-400`)
- **Linear** -- indigo (`#5E6AD2`)
- **Custom Task / Local Issue** -- amber (`text-amber-400`)
- **MCP Server** -- purple (`text-purple-400`)
- **Skill** -- pink (`text-pink-400`)
- **Plugin** -- warm copper (`#D4A574`)
- **Hooks** -- emerald (`text-emerald-400`)

### Label Color Hashing

Custom task labels get deterministic colors via `getLabelColor()`, which uses an FNV-1a hash of the label string to index into a 17-color palette:

```typescript
import { getLabelColor } from "../../theme";

const { text: textClass, bg: bgClass } = getLabelColor("frontend");
```

```

### Conditional Screens

Before the main UI renders, the app checks for several early-exit conditions:

1. **WelcomeScreen** -- shown when no projects exist (Electron) or no config exists (web mode).
2. **Loading state** -- shown when projects exist in Electron but the server is not ready yet.
3. **ProjectSetupScreen** -- shown when config is missing for the active Electron project.
4. **Auto-initializing** -- shown during automatic config detection (Electron with "auto" preference).

---

## Sidebar Components

### CreateForm (`src/ui/components/CreateForm.tsx`)

Tab switcher at the top of the sidebar with two tabs:

- **Branch** -- shows worktrees. Provides a "New Worktree" button.
- **Issues** -- shows issues from all configured integrations. Provides create buttons for Jira, Linear, and custom tasks based on which integrations are active.

### WorktreeList / WorktreeItem (`src/ui/components/WorktreeList.tsx`, `WorktreeItem.tsx`)

Displays all worktrees with filtering support. Each `WorktreeItem` shows the worktree name, branch, status indicator (running/stopped/creating), and linked issue badges (Jira, Linear, custom task). Clicking a worktree selects it and shows its detail panel.

### Issue Lists

- **JiraIssueList / JiraIssueItem** -- Jira issues with priority icons, status badges, and type indicators.
- **LinearIssueList / LinearIssueItem** -- Linear issues with state badges and priority indicators.
- **CustomTaskList / CustomTaskItem** -- Local custom tasks with status, priority dots, and label badges.

### IssueList (`src/ui/components/IssueList.tsx`)

Aggregator component that renders all issue types in a single scrollable list. Receives issues from all sources and delegates rendering to the type-specific list/item components. Handles the case where no integrations are configured by showing a prompt to set them up.

---

## Detail Panel Components

All detail panels live in `src/ui/components/detail/`.

### DetailPanel (`DetailPanel.tsx`)

The worktree detail view. Contains:

- **DetailHeader** -- worktree name (editable inline), branch name, status badge, start/stop/delete action buttons, linked issue badges.
- **Tab bar** -- Logs | Terminal | Hooks tabs. Tab state is tracked per worktree so switching between worktrees preserves each one's active tab.
- **Git action toolbar** -- contextual buttons for Commit (when uncommitted changes exist), Push (when unpushed commits exist), and PR (when pushed but no PR exists). Each expands an inline input form.
- **LogsViewer** -- streaming process output for running worktrees.
- **TerminalView** -- interactive xterm.js terminal. Terminal sessions are lazily created (only when the Terminal tab is first opened) and kept alive when switching tabs.
- **HooksTab** -- runs and displays hook results with visual state indicators (dashed borders for unrun hooks, circular progress spinner during execution, solid borders with card background for completed/disabled hooks). Supports multiple expanded items simultaneously; auto-expands all items when the full pipeline completes. Receives real-time updates via `hook-update` SSE events.

### JiraDetailPanel (`JiraDetailPanel.tsx`)

Shows Jira issue details: summary, description (rendered as Markdown from Atlassian Document Format), status, priority, assignee, and comments. Provides a "Create Worktree" button to spin up a worktree linked to the issue.

### LinearDetailPanel (`LinearDetailPanel.tsx`)

Similar to JiraDetailPanel but for Linear issues. Shows title, description, state, priority, assignee, and labels.

### CustomTaskDetailPanel (`CustomTaskDetailPanel.tsx`)

Detail view for local custom tasks. Supports inline editing of title, description, status, priority, and labels. Shows file attachments with image preview support.

### Other Detail Panels

- **McpServerDetailPanel** -- MCP server configuration, environment variables, deployment status across agents.
- **SkillDetailPanel** -- Skill markdown editing (skill.md, reference.md, examples.md), frontmatter editing, deployment status.
- **PluginDetailPanel** -- Claude plugin details, install/uninstall/enable/disable actions.

| `DetailHeader.tsx`       | Worktree name/branch display with inline edit and action buttons                |
| `NotesSection.tsx`       | PersonalNotesSection + AgentSection (tabbed: Context, Todos, Git Policy, Hooks) |
| `TodoList.tsx`           | Checkbox todo items attached to issues                                          |
| `AgentPolicySection.tsx` | Per-issue agent git policy overrides                                            |

---

## Hooks and Data Fetching

All hooks live in `src/ui/hooks/`.

### Real-Time Updates via SSE

**`useWorktrees`** (`useWorktrees.ts`) establishes an `EventSource` connection to `/api/events`. The server pushes several event types:

- `worktrees` -- worktree state updates (status, logs, git state)
- `notification` -- error/info notifications displayed as toast messages
- `hook-update` -- signals that hook results changed for a worktree, triggering auto-refetch in the HooksTab
- `activity-history` -- batch of recent events on initial connection (dispatched as `dawg:activity-history` CustomEvent)
- `activity` -- individual real-time activity events (dispatched as `dawg:activity` CustomEvent)

On connection error, it falls back to polling with a 5-second retry.

```typescript
const { worktrees, isConnected, error, refetch } = useWorktrees(onNotification, onHookUpdate);
```

Additional hooks in the same file:

- `useProjectName()` -- fetches the project name from config.
- `usePorts()` -- fetches discovered ports and offset step.
- `useJiraStatus()` / `useLinearStatus()` / `useGitHubStatus()` -- fetch integration connection status.

### React Query Hooks

These use TanStack React Query for caching, background refetching, and stale-while-revalidate:

| Hook                   | Query Key                             | Data Source                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `useJiraIssues`        | `['jira-issues', query, serverUrl]`   | `/api/jira/issues`         |
| `useJiraIssueDetail`   | `['jira-issue', key, serverUrl]`      | `/api/jira/issues/:key`    |
| `useLinearIssues`      | `['linear-issues', query, serverUrl]` | `/api/linear/issues`       |
| `useLinearIssueDetail` | `['linear-issue', id, serverUrl]`     | `/api/linear/issues/:id`   |
| `useCustomTasks`       | `['custom-tasks', serverUrl]`         | `/api/tasks`               |
| `useCustomTaskDetail`  | `['custom-task', id, serverUrl]`      | `/api/tasks/:id`           |
| `useMcpServers`        | various                               | `/api/mcp-servers`         |
| `useSkills`            | various                               | `/api/skills`              |
| `useNotes`             | `['notes', source, id, serverUrl]`    | `/api/notes/:source/:id`   |
| `useAgentRule`         | `['agentRule', fileId]`               | `/api/agent-rules/:fileId` |
| `useHooksConfig`       | `['hooks-config', serverUrl]`         | `/api/hooks/config`        |

Issue hooks support configurable refresh intervals (from integration settings) and search query debouncing (300ms).

### WebSocket Terminal

**`useTerminal`** (`useTerminal.ts`) manages interactive PTY sessions:

1. `connect()` -- POST to `/api/worktrees/:id/terminals` to create a session, then opens a WebSocket to `/api/terminals/:sessionId/ws`.
2. `sendData(data)` -- forwards keystrokes to the PTY via WebSocket.
3. `sendResize(cols, rows)` -- sends terminal resize events.
4. `disconnect()` -- closes WebSocket and destroys the server-side session.

Sessions are keyed by worktree ID. The `TerminalView` component lazily creates sessions and keeps them alive across tab switches within the same worktree.

### Configuration

**`useConfig`** (`useConfig.ts`) fetches `.dawg/config.json` from the server. Returns the config object, project name, whether a branch name rule exists, and loading state.

---

## API Layer

The API layer uses a two-file pattern:

### `api.ts` -- Raw fetch functions

Every API function accepts an optional `serverUrl` parameter as its last argument:

```typescript
export async function startWorktree(
  id: string,
  serverUrl: string | null = null,
): Promise<{ success: boolean; error?: string }>;
```

When `serverUrl` is `null` (web mode), requests use relative URLs. When provided (Electron mode), requests use the full URL (e.g., `http://localhost:6970/api/worktrees`).

The file contains functions for every API endpoint: worktree CRUD, git operations (commit, push, PR), Jira/Linear/GitHub integration management, terminal sessions, MCP server management, skills, plugins, notes, todos, hooks, and configuration.

### `useApi.ts` -- Bound hook

The `useApi()` hook reads the current `serverUrl` from `ServerContext` and returns a memoized object where every API function is pre-bound to that URL:

```typescript
const api = useApi();
await api.startWorktree(worktreeId); // serverUrl is automatically included
```

This means components never need to think about which server they are talking to.

---

## Selection State Management

The `Selection` type is a discriminated union that tracks what the user has selected in the sidebar:

```typescript
type Selection =
  | { type: "worktree"; id: string }
  | { type: "issue"; key: string }
  | { type: "linear-issue"; identifier: string }
  | { type: "custom-task"; id: string }
  | null;
```

### Persistence

Selection state is persisted to `localStorage` under the key `dawg:wsSel:{serverUrl}`. This means each project in Electron mode remembers its own selection independently.

Similarly persisted per server URL:

- Active view: `dawg:view:{serverUrl}`
- Active sidebar tab (branch/issues): `dawg:wsTab:{serverUrl}`
- Sidebar width: `dawg:sidebarWidth` (global, not per-project)

### Auto-Selection

When no selection exists and worktrees are available, the first worktree is auto-selected. When the selected worktree is deleted, selection falls back to the first remaining worktree. When the worktree list becomes empty, selection is cleared.

### Adding a New Selection Type

When adding a new selection type (e.g., a new integration), you must update:

1. The `Selection` union type in `App.tsx`.
2. The conditional rendering in the detail panel section of `App.tsx`.
3. The `IssueList` component to accept and render the new entity type.
4. The `CreateForm` component if the new type needs a creation button.
5. Any cross-linking logic (e.g., `findLinkedWorktree` pattern for the new type).

---

## Multi-Project Support (Electron)

### ServerContext (`src/ui/contexts/ServerContext.tsx`)

The `ServerProvider` wraps the entire app and manages multi-project state:

```typescript
interface ServerContextValue {
  serverUrl: string | null;           // Active project's API URL
  projects: Project[];                // All open projects
  activeProject: Project | null;      // Currently selected project
  openProject: (path: string) => Promise<...>;
  closeProject: (id: string) => Promise<void>;
  switchProject: (id: string) => void;
  isElectron: boolean;
  selectFolder: () => Promise<string | null>;
}
```

Each project is a separate dawg server running on a different port. The `serverUrl` is derived from the active project's port: `http://localhost:{port}`.

Hooks like `useServerUrlOptional()` return `null` when no project is active, which disables API calls and SSE connections.

### TabBar

In Electron mode, a `TabBar` component appears at the bottom of the screen showing all open projects as tabs. Users can switch between projects, open new ones via a folder picker, and close projects.

### Web Mode

In web mode (no Electron), the app behaves as a single-project application. The `ServerProvider` still exists but `serverUrl` defaults to `null` (relative URLs), `projects` is empty, and `isElectron` is `false`.

---

## Resizable Sidebar

The sidebar width is adjustable via a `ResizableHandle` component positioned between the sidebar and detail panel. The width is constrained between 200px and 500px (default 300px) and persisted to both `localStorage` and Electron preferences (when available).

---

## Animation Patterns

The app uses Framer Motion for transitions:

- **View switching** -- `AnimatePresence` with `mode="wait"` for sidebar tab transitions (worktree list / issue list slide in from opposite directions).
- **Header fade-in** -- the header fades in on initial render.
- **Background blobs** -- the configuration, integrations, and hooks views have animated gradient blobs drifting in the background via CSS keyframe animations.
- **Sweeping border** (currently commented out) -- hook items previously displayed a teal gradient "comet" that sweeps around the card border during execution. The `SweepingBorder` component is still defined in `HooksTab.tsx` but its usage is commented out, replaced by a circular progress spinner (`Loader2`) in the status icon position. The CSS keyframes (`border-sweep`, `border-sweep-fade`) remain defined in `src/ui/index.css`.

---
